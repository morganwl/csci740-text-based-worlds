\section{Lessons learned}

Most of the lessons learned in this project are within the domain of
logic-based artificial intelligence. I learned how to implement
tell, store, unify and fetch algorithms for a first-order logic
knowledge base. I learned how to adapt those algorithms to accommodate
temporal states, and to add a linear implication operator. I learned how
to implement forward chaining to make inferences from observations and
implications. I also learned a tiny bit about knowledge engineering and
ways to frame logical sentences about cause and effect relationships in
a way that would be relevant to an AI agent.

I learned how to work with the predominant framework in the study of AI
agents for text-based games, TextWorld\cite{cote_textworld_2019}, and
how to create my own procedural generation models in that framework.
I read a number of papers about different techniques for approaching
text-based games, techniques that I look forward to exploring more in
the future, and potentially incorporating into my own work.
