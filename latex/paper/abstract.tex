    Text-based games, also called text adventures or interactive
    fiction, are a form of games meant to evoke reading a work of
    fiction, where the player controls the main character, popularized
    in the 1980s by games like Zork I\cite{blank_zork_1980}. Players
    interact with the environment through text commands and the game
    gives feedback in the form of natural language descriptions. I
    developed the beginnings of a knowledge and logic-based agent to
    leverage logical reasoning in solving rudimentary text-based games.
