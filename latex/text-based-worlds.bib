@article{atkinson_text-based_2019,
 abstract = {In 2016-2018 at the IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Games, the authors of this paper ran a competition for agents that can play classic text-based adventure games. This competition fills a gap in existing game artificial intelligence (AI) competitions that have typically focused on traditional card/board games or modern video games with graphical interfaces. By providing a platform for evaluating agents in textbased adventures, the competition provides a novel benchmark for game AI with unique challenges for natural language understanding and generation. This paper summarizes the three competitions ran in 2016-2018 (including details of open-source implementations of both the competition framework and our competitors) and presents the results of an improved evaluation of these competitors across 20 games.},

 abstract = {We introduce TextWorld, a sandbox learning environment for the training and evaluation of RL agents on text-based games. TextWorld is a Python library that handles interactive play-through of text games, as well as backend functions like state tracking and reward assignment. It comes with a curated list of games whose features and challenges we have analyzed. More significantly, it enables users to handcraft or automatically generate new games. Its generative mechanisms give precise control over the difficulty, scope, and language of constructed games, and can be used to relax challenges inherent to commercial text games like partial observability and sparse rewards. By generating sets of varied but similar games, TextWorld can also be used to study generalization and transfer learning. We cast text-based games in the Reinforcement Learning formalism, use our framework to develop a set of benchmark games, and evaluate several baseline agents on this set and the curated list.},

@article{dambekodi_playing_2020,
 abstract = {Text based games are simulations in which an agent interacts with the world purely through natural language. They typically consist of a number of puzzles interspersed with interactions with common everyday objects and locations. Deep reinforcement learning agents can learn to solve these puzzles. However, the everyday interactions with the environment, while trivial for human players, present as additional puzzles to agents. We explore two techniques for incorporating commonsense knowledge into agents. Inferring possibly hidden aspects of the world state with either a commonsense inference model COMET, or a language model BERT. Biasing an agents exploration according to common patterns recognized by a language model. We test our technique in the 9to05 game, which is an extreme version of a text based game that requires numerous interactions with common, everyday objects in common, everyday scenarios. We conclude that agents that augment their beliefs about the world state with commonsense inferences are more robust to observational errors and omissions of common elements from text descriptions.},

 abstract = {A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to understand and communicate with language. Interactive Fiction games are fully text-based simulation environments where a player issues text commands to effect change in the environment and progress through the story. We argue that IF games are an excellent testbed for studying language-based autonomous agents. In particular, IF games combine challenges of combinatorial action spaces, language understanding, and commonsense reasoning. To facilitate rapid development of language-based agents, we introduce Jericho, a learning environment for man-made IF games and conduct a comprehensive study of text-agents across a rich set of games, highlighting directions in which agents can improve.},
