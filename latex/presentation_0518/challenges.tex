    \frametitle{Challenges: Problems of text-based games}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Recognizing action acceptance and rejection from
                game description
            \item Object identification and distinction --- some objects
                have the same name but are not the same object.
                Sometimes the name of an object will change.
        \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Challenges: Implementation of logical agent}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Working with TextWorld's GameGenerator tool
        \item Choosing the right logic
        \item Logic-based agents require a lot of internal functionality
            before any reasoning can be performed
        \item Finding the best way to represent time in the KB
        \item Back-chaining is not sound for Linear Logic
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Unfinished Goals}

    \begin{block}{Logic-based agent}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item While I almost finished the logic-based KB for Rover
                Two, I wasn't able to deploy it
            \item Did not implement equality, leaving problem of object
                identification unsolved
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

    \begin{block}{Generalize observations}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Did not extend my rules to cover reasoning beyond
                location and movement, (i.e. object interaction)
            \item Did not add mechanism for creating new rules from
                observations
        \end{itemize}
    \end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Future steps}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Look at Bayes nets, or some other method of measuring
            uncertainty
        \item Incorporate word embeddings for better parsing and
            guessing object types
        \item Guess actions based on word embeddings and learn
            associated rules
    \end{itemize}
