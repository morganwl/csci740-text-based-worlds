\section{Problem Description and Goals}

    \frametitle{Abstract}
    Text-based games, also called text adventures or interactive
    fiction, are a form of parser-driven text-based worlds where players
    control a Player Character in an immersive environment. Players
    interact with the environment by issuing text commands such as, ``go
    west'' or ``unlock the door with the bronze key'' and the game gives
    feedback in the form of natural language scene descriptions, e.g.
    ``You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a
    boarded front door'' (Zork, Infocom, 1981). I would like to use
    pre-trained GloVe word embeddings to aid in parsing scene
    descriptions and action exploration, and, which in turn will be used
    to train a knowledge base that will be used for goal completion,
    with the hope that this will allow for effective knowledge transfer
    between a wide array of text adventure games.

    \frametitle{An AI agent to solve mazes in text-based worlds}

    Traditional text adventures remain largely unsolvable by AI agents,
    but constrained benchmark games can be created that allow agents to
    focus on specific skills.

    \begin{block}{Goal: Design an agent to solve increasingly
        complex mazes}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Trivial mazes (interconnected areas without obstacles) 
            \item Simple obstacles such as doors
            \item Composite obstacles such as locked doors
            \item Stretch goal: complex, novel obstacles
        \end{enumerate}

        Wherever possible, pursue an approach that favors generalization
        and interpretability.
